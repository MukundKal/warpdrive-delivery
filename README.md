Problem?

Amidst the growing dominance of big e-commerce sites like amazon, local businesses

have been mostly hampered by tactics such as stealing products and selling them by

undercutting prices.

Solution:

**Decentralization:** Our p2p app will serve the purpose of faster delivery of products

from local stores saving customers time and also help the businesses sustain growth

and allow them to survive. **This is especially relevant in the current time with**

**thousands of local businesses being driven out of business due to low sales**. This

app would allow them to take online orders and reach new customers better and

faster.

**Target Users**:

*Local Shopkeepers:*This app is mainly beneficial for those shopkeepers who are

only able to cater their products to the locality that their shops are in and wish to be

able to get a wide range of customers buying their products especially in the

pandemic times where live person sales have dropped by a lot.

_General Public:_ This app is helpful to the general public to search and order from

shops from outside their locality. This might help them get access to items that their

fav local items just with a few taps. The delivery times are also very quick relative to

Amazon and they can support local businesses.
